                Hi, I’m Nithin. I'm a multi-talented human with over 2+ years of experiences in wide range of web
                development.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also call me a product designer, experience designer, interaction, UI, UX or by any other market
                defined function-title. I'm also a multi-disciplinary maker with over 2 years of experiences in wide
                range of Web designs,front-end developer,
                traveler, photographer and more.
            </p>
            <p>

                I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills
                can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do
                interesting things that matter.

            </p>
            <p>

                Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I’m easily inspired and more then willing to
                follow my fascinations wherever they take me. I’m passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a
                natural ability to entertain and inspire. I’m never satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead I have
                an almost impulsive need to act on them.

            </p>
            <p>

                My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic
                endeavors. I’m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with
                relative ease.

            </p>
            <p>
